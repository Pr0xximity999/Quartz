# introduction
Hiiii
So this is like, my(Tom's) place to write blogs, school stuff, random information and anything i feel like really.

At the moment you might notice something:
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
its quite empty
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
That'll fix itself eventually whenever i feel like adding more stuff, folders or wiki's.

# Information

## Folder system
There's a system to the folders, you'll figure it out probably.

Its based on [FILL THIS IN](index)

Basically, the top folders have number ranges consisting of 10 slots. These are usually the general category of the contents.
>**Example:**
>``20 - 29 School`` is the directory in which i place anything regarding my uni (stuff like notes in classes, lectures etc).
