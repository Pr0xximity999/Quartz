# introduction
Hiiii
So this is like, my(Tom's) digital garden to write blogs, school stuff, random information, ideas i might get or anything i feel like really.

At the moment you might notice something:
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
its quite empty<br>
<sup><sup>(just like my brain)</sup></sup>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
That'll fix itself eventually whenever i feel like adding more stuff, folders or wiki's.

>haha made you look

# Information
## Tags
I give every file some tags that resemble the content, things like: 
#lectoraat / #informative / #school
But also what language the page is in: 
#language/dutch / #language/ / #taal/engels / #taal/nederlands 

## Folder system
There's a system to the folders, you'll figure it out probably.

Its based on [source yet to come] #content-to-come

Basically, the top folders have number ranges consisting of 10 slots. These are usually the general category of the contents.
>[!info] **Example:**
>``20 - 29 School`` is the directory in which i place anything regarding my uni (stuff like notes in classes, lectures etc). 

Inside those folders are (up to) 10 subfolders containing a certain topic (like lectures) and inside *those* folders are files that correlate to the topic (like lectures).
 Every file number is the folder number + its own number (ranging from 00 - 99) 
>[!info] Example:
> The lecture about [[22.02 - Cyber warfare|Cyber warfare]] is file 2 inside folder 22, so 22.02

If i run out of space inside a relevant topic or general topic, it means i need to sort it more specifically
