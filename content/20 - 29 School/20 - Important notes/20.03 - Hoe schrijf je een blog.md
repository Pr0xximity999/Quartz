# What is a blog?

The word blog comes from weblog(web log), which means that someone on the web has written a log or piece of text about something that they have learned/discovered/came up with/etc. The exact definition of blog differs on who you ask though.

On our project #smart-energy, the following definition will be used:
>*A blog is an informative or inspiring series of short, personal pieces of text which appear online and regularly with an informal writing style.

The goal of a blog is to inspire or give something useful to the reader. The content will be read in a more chill manner giving the blog a personal element.

Of course, the web part of a **web**log means that it has to be online somewhere, people need to be able to read it after all, and the log part of a web**log** means that it consists of multiple pieces of text(logs).

The nice thing about a blog is that it doesn't have to stand up to any standard or writing style you learn in schools. You can use your own informal writing style, which makes it easer to write. (look at it as if you're writing down your own thoughts)


# The structure of a blog
The structure of the blog (or at least according to my school) consists of 5 different parts:
- The title
- The paragraph structure
- The images
- The call to action

## The title
The title of your blog will be the thing that catches the reader's attention. Make it interesting or enticing to read. It also sets the theme of the blog.

## The paragraph structure
A blog consists of short pieces of text, so this means it has a bunch of small headers/paragraphs.
The use of (sub)headers will make your blogpost more organized and easier to navigate trough
Make small paragraphs ranging from 3 to 8 sentences and use many whitespaces.
If there's a new subject then you need a new paragraph on a new whitespace. 
Use bullet points for lists and and make your blogpost easy to read.

## The images
Images can give extra context to your blogposts (plus it also makes it look nicer). Of course your images need to support your posts, so don't adding random memes to your blogposts (I'm not stopping you though).

# The call to action
A call to action is what it says, to call your reader to do something(an action). This can range from making them comment on your blog, to clicking a link somewhere or making them try something out you wrote about.
For example: [Click this link to get some tips for a good call to action](https://succesvol-bloggen.nl/de-inhoud/5-tips-voor-de-perfecte-call-to-action/)(it's written in Dutch).

So now that you're all caught up on how to write blogs, go out there, and write stuff! Be creative! Learn something new! But most importantly, have fun while doing so:3
