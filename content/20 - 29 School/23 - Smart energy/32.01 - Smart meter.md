# Intro
As written in [[22.01 - Smart energy#Smart sensor]], we're going to make our own smart meter and put it in my house's electrical box so it can measure our energy usage. The data will be sent to school who shares it on their website. To see my sensor data i have to log in with the unique code that corresponds with my meter.

# Soldering
In class we got a kit of components consisting of:
- 1 pcb board
- 2 phone cable connectors (p1)
- 8 resistors (3 and 5 of both diffrent resistances)
- 2 transistors
- 2 diodes
- 1 rgb LED
- 1 button
- 1 integrated circuit

Soldering it at first was kinda tricky, using the right amount and using the right technique is something you gotta learn while doing it.

Otherwise it will turn out like this:

But after some time and finageling around i soldered it all down

The trick it so put your soldering iron on the little ring around the hole and put a tiny but of solder alloy on the iron and let it slide between the hole and the pin.
You know it has enough when the ring around the pin gets all covered with molten soldering alloy in a smooth motion.
