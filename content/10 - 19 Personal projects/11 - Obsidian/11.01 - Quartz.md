# Info
Quartz is software that generates web pages using markup files, you can use it to host documents or [digital gardens](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) and the like.
I myself use it to host my notes and documentation on anything i feel like.

In this document I'll explain how to [[#Installing Quartz|install quartz]] and how to [[#Hosting your quartz page on github pages|host it on github pages]] to host it (for free!)

# Installing Quartz
>[!info] official documentation
>If you want to follow the steps from the official site, go to https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/ (or look at it if you want to do anything apart installing it or hosting it on github pages)

>[!info] prequesites
> - [Node](https://nodejs.org/) V20 (at least)
> - git

Open up your command terminal (for example cmd) at the directory you want to install quartz at and type in the following commands line by line:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git
cd quartz
npm i
npx quartz create
```

This will create a quartz folder with everything you need to create a quartz page.

# Backing up quartz to your git repository
To sync quartz between devices (or to [[#Hosting your quartz page on github pages|host it on github pages]]) you need to create an empty repository on github.
1. go to https://github.com and log in (or create an account)
2. on your dashboard in the top left, press the green <button>*new*</button> button

3. Give your repository a name (i named mine quartz)
4. dont change anything else (keep the repository visibility on **Public**)
5. click <button>*Create repository*</button>
   ![[Pasted image 20240916212450.png]]
6. Inside your repository, click the green <button>* Code*</button> button and copy the https url ``eg: https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git``
7. Open up your command terminal inside the quartz root folder and type the following command lines:
```shell
# list all the repositories that are tracked
git remote -v 

# if the origin doesn't match your own repository, set your repository as the origin
git remote set-url origin <the url you copied> 

# if you don't have upstream as a remote, add it so updates work
git remote add upstream https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git
```
# Writing markdown Inside quartz
Inside the ``content`` folder in your ``quartz`` folder, you can make markdown files (and folders) for quartz to read.
If you're using [obsidian] #content-to-come, you need to open the ``content`` folder inside obsidian and start working in there.

# Previewing your quartz page
If you have [[#Installing Quartz|installed]] quartz, [[#Writing markdown Inside quartz|wrote something inside]], and want to preview your page, You can run the following command (while being in the quartz root directory) inside your terminal of choice:
```shell
npx quartz build --serve
```
The page will be shown at http://localhost:8080 and will automatically update if you edit/create/delete files
<sub>(for some command flags and options, look at the [official documentation](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/build))</sub>
