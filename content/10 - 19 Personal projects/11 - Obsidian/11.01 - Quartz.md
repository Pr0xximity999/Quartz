# Info
Quartz is software that generates web pages using markup files, you can use it to host documents or [digital gardens](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) and the like.
I myself use it to host my notes and documentation on anything i feel like.

In this document I'll explain how to [[#Installing Quartz|install quartz]] and how to [[#hosting quartz on github pages|host it on github pages]] to host it (for free!)

# Installing Quartz
>[!info] official documentation
>If you want to follow the steps from the official site, go to https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/ (or look at it if you want to do anything apart installing it or hosting it on github pages)

>[!info] prequesites
> - [Node](https://nodejs.org/) V20 (at least)
> - git

Open up your command terminal (for example cmd) at the directory you want to install quartz at and type in the following commands line by line:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git
cd quartz
npm i
npx quartz create
```

This will create a quartz folder with everything you need to create a quartz page.

# Writing markdown Inside quartz
Inside the ``content`` folder in your ``quartz`` folder, you can make markdown files (and folders) for quartz to read.
If you're using [obsidian] #content-to-come, you need to open the ``content`` folder inside obsidian and start working in there.

# Previewing your quartz page
If you have [[#Installing Quartz|installed]] quartz, [[#Writing markdown Inside quartz|wrote something inside]], and want to preview your page, You can run the following command (while being in the quartz root directory) inside your terminal of choice:
```shell
npx quartz build --serve
```
